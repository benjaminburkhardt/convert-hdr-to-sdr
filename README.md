# HDR to SDR Converter using ffmpeg

I accidently recorded a lot of videos with the iPhone 11 in HDR and realized that editing HDR is pretty hard.

# What it does
The script converts all movie files in the same and sub folder to SDR.

# How to use
Clone the repo and move the files to convert in the same folder. Then run the script.
```
 ./convert_hdr_to_sdr.sh
```
